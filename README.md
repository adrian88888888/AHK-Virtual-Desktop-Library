# Working AHK Example:
```autohotkey
#Include AHK_Vitrual_Desktop_Library.ahk

q::GoToNextDesktop()
w::GoToPrevDesktop()

1::GoToDesktopNumber(1)
2::GoToDesktopNumber(2)
3::GoToDesktopNumber(3)

z::
currentDesktop := GetCurrentDesktopNumber()
MsgBox, You are on desktop number %currentDesktop%
return

x::MoveCurrentWindowToDesktop(3)

a::CallFunctionOnDesktopSwitch(true)

OnDesktopSwitch(){
	MsgBox, I run every time the desktop changes
}

s::CallFunctionOnDesktopSwitch(false)

AlwaysOpenOnDesktopNumber(3,"MSPaintApp") ;opens paint always on desktop 3

Escape::ExitApp
```

# Installation:
1. Download the ".ahk" file and the "VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll"
2. Does not matter where you put the folder but the 2 files have to be in the SAME folder
3. Then include in your script the ahk library like this:
```autohotkey
#Include ...the-dir-with-the-2-files...\AHK_Vitrual_Desktop_Library.ahk
```
4. This DLL and library works only on 64 bit Windows 10 and it was tested with 1809 build 17663<br/>
Also you probably need [VS 2017 runtimes vc_redist.x64.exe and/or vc_redist.x86.exe](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads "VS 2017 runtimes vc_redist.x64.exe and/or vc_redist.x86.exe"), if they are not installed already

I want to thank Ciantic because he did the .dll that connects with Windows, thats black magic for me, so thanks<br/>

I want to thank lschwahn because he did a complex program and i took ideas from his code<br/>

As a newbie I couldn't find something easy to use, something ready to go, something with documentation, so here it is, thatÂ´s the only part where I take credit

Also thanks to tom-bowles for a "bug fix" [here](https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor/issues/4 "here"), it was really usefull<br/>
